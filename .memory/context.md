# Current Context

<!-- LAYER 3: Derived projection. Ephemeral. Regenerate from CHANGELOG.md + graph.md when stale. -->
<!-- Last generated: 2026-02-26 12:00 | Event horizon: evt-001 -->
<!-- Staleness: compare Event horizon above with last event in CHANGELOG.md. Mismatch = regenerate. -->

## Active Mission

Unified AI development ecosystem: Rules (four rule files), seven Skills (memory-system-setup, rules-setup, skill-builder, blueprints-setup, tasks-setup, recipes-setup, subagents-setup), and memory system. Maintain documentation accuracy and protocol alignment; use memory system for event-sourced trajectory.

## Current Sprint

| Task | Priority | Assignee | Status | Blockers |
|------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| — | — | — | — | — |

## Active Constraints

- Append-only CHANGELOG Event Log; regenerate context when stale — evt-001
- Prefer scripts over manual steps (AUTOMATING pillar)
- Three Pillars (AUTOMATING, TESTING, DOCUMENTING) before task complete

## Blockers

- (none)

## Recent Changes

- 2026-02-26 — Memory System Setup skill and automation scripts; gaps closed; skill renamed to memory-system-setup — evt-001

## Key Dependencies

- (none yet)

## Next Actions

1. Regenerate this context when new events are appended to CHANGELOG.md
2. Use memory-system/scripts/validate-memory.py when changing memory files
