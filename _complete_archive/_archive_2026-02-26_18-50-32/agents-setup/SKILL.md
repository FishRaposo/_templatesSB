description: Use this skill when creating, improving, or auditing AGENTS.md files for any repository. This includes generating new AGENTS.md from scratch with built-in prompt validation, analyzing codebases, enforcing the Three Pillars Framework (AUTOMATING, TESTING, DOCUMENTING), embedding the complete Prompt Validation Protocol, creating nested directory-level overrides, and setting up cross-tool compatibility.

# Agents Setup Skill

I'll help you create effective AGENTS.md files that guide AI coding agents to produce code matching your project's conventions. When you invoke this skill, I can analyze your codebase and generate a complete AGENTS.md, improve an existing one, or set up a multi-level agent instruction hierarchy.

# Core Approach — The Three Pillars Framework

Every effective AGENTS.md must enforce three pillars. If any pillar is missing, agents produce incomplete work:

| Pillar | What It Covers | Without It |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **AUTOMATING** | Commands, CI, linting, formatting, build scripts | Agent guesses how to verify work — runs wrong commands, breaks builds |
| **TESTING** | Test commands, coverage expectations, test-first rules | Agent ships untested code or skips regressions |
| **DOCUMENTING** | Self-updating AGENTS.md, change-type checklists, doc parity | AGENTS.md becomes stale within days, next agent gets wrong instructions |

**The rule**: A task is not complete until all three pillars are satisfied — code is verified (AUTOMATING), tested (TESTING), and the AGENTS.md is updated if the change affects it (DOCUMENTING).

My approach:
1. Analyze the project's tech stack, structure, and conventions
2. Cover the six core areas: commands, testing, project structure, code style, git workflow, and boundaries
3. Write concrete, actionable instructions — not vague descriptions
4. Set clear three-tier boundaries (always do / ask first / never do)
5. **Enforce the Three Pillars** — every generated AGENTS.md includes AUTOMATING, TESTING, and DOCUMENTING sections with explicit enforcement rules
6. **Add Prompt Validation** — every generated AGENTS.md includes a pre-task validation gate that catches vague, incomplete, or unsafe prompts before execution

# Step-by-Step Instructions

## 1. Analyze the Codebase

First, I'll examine the project to gather the information agents need:

- **Tech stack**: Identify languages, frameworks, versions, and key dependencies
- **Project structure**: Map the directory layout, entry points, and key files
- **Commands**: Find build, lint, test, and format commands from package.json, Makefile, pyproject.toml, etc.
- **Code style**: Detect naming conventions, patterns, and formatting choices from existing code
- **Git workflow**: Check for commit conventions, PR templates, branch naming from git config and CI files
- **Boundaries**: Identify sensitive files, generated code, vendor directories, and secrets

**JavaScript/TypeScript project — discovery commands:**
```bash
# Discover commands
cat package.json | jq '.scripts'

# Detect framework and versions
cat package.json | jq '.dependencies, .devDependencies'

# Find linter/formatter configs
ls .eslintrc* .prettierrc* tsconfig.json biome.json 2>/dev/null

# Check for CI
ls .github/workflows/*.yml 2>/dev/null

# Check for existing agent instructions
ls AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md .cursorrules .windsurfrules 2>/dev/null
```

**Python project — discovery commands:**
```bash
# Discover commands
cat pyproject.toml | grep -A 20 '\[tool.poetry.scripts\]'
cat Makefile 2>/dev/null

# Detect framework and versions
cat pyproject.toml | grep -A 50 '\[tool.poetry.dependencies\]'
pip list --format=json | python -c "import sys,json; [print(p['name'],p['version']) for p in json.load(sys.stdin)]"

# Find linter/formatter configs
ls pyproject.toml setup.cfg .flake8 .ruff.toml mypy.ini 2>/dev/null
```

**Go project — discovery commands:**
```bash
# Discover dependencies and Go version
cat go.mod

# Find build/test commands
cat Makefile 2>/dev/null
ls .goreleaser.yml 2>/dev/null
```

## 2. Write the AGENTS.md

Structure the file covering all six core areas. Put commands early — agents reference them constantly.

**Minimal effective structure:**

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3 (strict mode)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 9

## Commands
# Lint a single file
npx eslint --fix path/to/file.tsx

# Type-check a single file
npx tsc --noEmit path/to/file.tsx

# Run a single test
npx vitest run path/to/file.test.tsx

# Full build (use sparingly)
pnpm build

## Project Structure
- `src/app/` — Pages and layouts
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components
- `src/lib/` — Utilities and helpers

## Do
- Use named exports for components
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Default to small, focused components

## Don't
- Do not use `any` type
- Do not hardcode colors — use design tokens
- Do not add dependencies without approval

## Boundaries
- ✅ **Always**: Run lint and tests on changed files, satisfy all Three Pillars
- ⚠️ **Ask first**: Schema changes, new dependencies
- 🚫 **Never**: Commit secrets, edit vendor/, remove tests

## Three Pillars — Every Task Must Satisfy All Three

A task is **not complete** until:
1. ✅ **AUTOMATING** — Lint, type-check, and format pass on all changed files
2. ✅ **TESTING** — Tests pass, new code has tests, no tests removed
3. ✅ **DOCUMENTING** — This AGENTS.md is updated if the change affects it

Skipping any pillar = incomplete work.
```

**Why each section matters:**

| Section | Without It | With It |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Tech Stack | Agent guesses versions → subtle API bugs | Correct imports and patterns |
| Commands | Agent runs full builds → minutes wasted | File-scoped checks in seconds |
| Project Structure | Agent re-explores every chat | Starts where humans would start |
| Do / Don't | Agent uses random patterns | Mirrors your best practices |
| Boundaries | Agent touches prod configs | Safe, controlled changes |

## 3. Add File-Scoped Commands

Agents that run project-wide builds on every change waste time. Prefer per-file commands:

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
```markdown
## Commands
# Type-check one file (seconds, not minutes)
npx tsc --noEmit path/to/file.tsx

# Format one file
npx prettier --write path/to/file.tsx

# Lint one file
npx eslint --fix path/to/file.tsx

# Test one file
npx vitest run path/to/file.test.tsx

# Full build — only when explicitly requested
pnpm build

Note: Always lint, type-check, and test changed files. Use full builds sparingly.
```

**Python:**
```markdown
## Commands
# Type-check one file
mypy path/to/file.py

# Format one file
ruff format path/to/file.py

# Lint one file
ruff check --fix path/to/file.py

# Test one file
pytest path/to/test_file.py -v

# Full test suite
pytest --cov
```

**Go:**
```markdown
## Commands
# Vet one package
go vet ./path/to/package/

# Format one file
gofmt -w path/to/file.go

# Test one package
go test ./path/to/package/ -v

# Full test suite
go test ./... -race -cover
```

## 4. Write Concrete Do's and Don'ts

The most impactful section. Build this iteratively: run prompts, note mistakes, add rules.

**Effective pattern — be specific, not abstract:**

```markdown
## Do
- Use MUI v3 — ensure code is v3 compatible
- Use emotion `css={{}}` prop format for styling
- Use mobx for state management with `useLocalStore`
- Use design tokens from `src/lib/theme/tokens.ts` for all styling
- Use Apex Charts for charts — do not supply custom HTML tooltips
- Default to small components and small diffs

## Don't
- Do not hardcode colors, spacing, or breakpoints
- Do not use `div` when a semantic element or existing component fits
- Do not add new heavy dependencies without approval
- Do not use class-based components — use functional with hooks
```

**Anti-pattern — too vague to be useful:**
```markdown
## Do
- Write clean code
- Follow best practices
- Use good naming

## Don't
- Don't write bad code
```

## 5. Set Three-Tier Boundaries

Use the always / ask-first / never pattern to prevent destructive mistakes:

```markdown
## Boundaries
- ✅ **Always**: Write to `src/` and `tests/`, run tests before commits, follow naming conventions
- ⚠️ **Ask first**: Database schema changes, adding dependencies, modifying CI/CD config
- 🚫 **Never**: Commit secrets or API keys, edit `node_modules/` or `vendor/`, remove failing tests
```

**Safety and permissions (for tools that support it):**
```markdown
## Safety and Permissions
Allowed without prompt:
- Read/list files
- Single-file type-check, format, lint
- Run individual unit tests

Ask first:
- Package installs
- Git push, force operations
- File deletion
- Full build or E2E suites
```

## 6. Add Concrete Code Examples

One real snippet beats three paragraphs. Point to actual files showing your best patterns.

```markdown
## Code Examples

**Good patterns to copy:**
- Forms: see `src/components/forms/CreateUserForm.tsx`
- Tables: see `src/components/data/DataGrid.tsx`
- API calls: see `src/services/api-client.ts`

**Legacy patterns to avoid:**
- Class components like `src/legacy/Admin.tsx`
- Direct fetch in components like `src/old/Dashboard.tsx`

**Style example:**
```typescript
// ✅ Good — descriptive names, proper error handling
export async function fetchUserById(id: string): Promise<User> {
  if (!id) throw new AppError('User ID required', 'VALIDATION');
  const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
  return response.data;
}

// ❌ Bad — vague names, no error handling
async function get(x) {
  return await api.get('/users/' + x).data;
}
```
```

## 7. Set Up Nested Overrides (Monorepos)

For large repos, place directory-specific `AGENTS.md` files:

```
my-monorepo/
├── AGENTS.md                        ← repo-wide defaults
├── packages/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── AGENTS.md               ← API-specific (Express, Prisma)
│   ├── web/
│   │   └── AGENTS.md               ← Web-specific (React 18, Tailwind)
│   └── shared/
│       └── AGENTS.md               ← Shared lib rules
└── services/
    └── payments/
        └── AGENTS.override.md      ← Payments overrides (stricter security)
```

Rules cascade: the agent reads the closest file to the work it's doing. Use `AGENTS.override.md` to completely replace (not extend) parent rules for sensitive areas.

## 8. Enforce the Three Pillars

This is the most critical step. Every AGENTS.md must include a **Three Pillars** section that makes automation, testing, and documentation an inseparable part of every task — not optional extras.

### Pillar 1: AUTOMATING

The AUTOMATING pillar ensures agents verify their work with the project's actual tools. This is covered by the Commands section (Step 3), but must also be reinforced as a mandatory post-task behavior:

```markdown
## Task Completion — AUTOMATING

After every code change, run these checks on the files you modified:

1. **Lint**: `npx eslint --fix path/to/changed/file.tsx`
2. **Type-check**: `npx tsc --noEmit path/to/changed/file.tsx`
3. **Format**: `npx prettier --write path/to/changed/file.tsx`

A task is not complete until all three pass. Do not commit code that fails linting or type-checking.
```

### Pillar 2: TESTING

The TESTING pillar ensures agents never ship untested code. Include explicit testing expectations:

```markdown
## Task Completion — TESTING

Every code change must include verification:

- **New features**: Write tests before or alongside the implementation
- **Bug fixes**: Add a regression test that reproduces the bug, then fix
- **Refactors**: Run existing tests to confirm no regressions

Run tests on changed files: `npx vitest run path/to/changed/file.test.tsx`

Do not remove or weaken existing tests to make the suite pass.
```

### Pillar 3: DOCUMENTING

The DOCUMENTING pillar ensures AGENTS.md stays current. It uses explicit change-type checklists so agents know exactly what to update:

```markdown
## Task Completion — DOCUMENTING

This AGENTS.md must stay in sync with the codebase. After completing any task, check whether your changes require updates here.

**By change type:**

| Change Type | Update These Sections |
|-------------|----------------------|
| New dependency | Tech Stack |
| New command or script | Commands |
| New directory or moved files | Project Structure |
| New pattern established | Do section |
| Anti-pattern discovered | Don't section |
| New config, CI, or tooling | Relevant sections |
| Git workflow change | Git Workflow |
| Bug fix | Don't section (if it was a recurring mistake) |
| Refactor | Project Structure, Code Examples |
| Security change | Boundaries |

**How to update:**
1. After completing your primary task, review what changed
2. Update the relevant AGENTS.md section(s) in the same commit/PR
3. Keep updates minimal and factual — match the existing style
4. If working in a subdirectory with its own AGENTS.md, update that file instead

**Do not:**
- Skip the update because "it's a small change" — small drift compounds
- Rewrite sections unrelated to your change
- Remove existing rules without explicit approval
```

### Putting It Together: The Three Pillars Block

For maximum impact, add a single reinforcement block that ties all three pillars together:

```markdown
## Three Pillars — Every Task Must Satisfy All Three

A task is **not complete** until:
1. ✅ **AUTOMATING** — Lint, type-check, and format pass on all changed files
2. ✅ **TESTING** — Tests pass, new code has tests, no tests removed
3. ✅ **DOCUMENTING** — This AGENTS.md is updated if the change affects it

Skipping any pillar = incomplete work.
```

### Three Pillars Validation by Change Type

This table shows which pillar actions are required for each type of change:

| Change Type | AUTOMATING | TESTING | DOCUMENTING |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **New feature** | Lint + type-check + format | New tests required | Update Structure, Do, Commands if needed |
| **Bug fix** | Lint + type-check | Regression test required | Update Don't section if recurring |
| **Refactor** | Lint + type-check + format | Run existing tests | Update Structure, Code Examples |
| **Dependency change** | Lint + type-check | Run full suite | Update Tech Stack, Commands |
| **Config change** | Lint if applicable | Smoke test | Update Commands, Boundaries |
| **Documentation only** | N/A | N/A | Update AGENTS.md if structural |

**For the agent generating the AGENTS.md:** Always include the Three Pillars section. Adapt the specific commands to the project's tech stack. This is not optional — it's the enforcement mechanism that keeps AGENTS.md alive and code quality consistent.

## 9. Add Prompt Validation Reference

Every generated AGENTS.md should reference the **Prompt Validation Protocol** to ensure agents validate what they're asked to do before executing. This prevents agents from acting on vague, incomplete, or unsafe prompts — catching problems at the input, not the output.

### Why This Matters

| Without Prompt Validation | With Prompt Validation |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Agent guesses intent from vague prompts | Agent confirms scope before starting |
| Unsafe operations slip through | Security scan catches dangerous patterns |
| Agent builds the wrong thing from ambiguous requests | Agent asks for clarification upfront |
| Output format undefined — agent picks randomly | Output format confirmed before execution |

### What to Include in Generated AGENTS.md

Add a brief reference section that points to the standalone protocol:

```markdown
## Prompt Validation Protocol

**All agents MUST validate user prompts before execution** using `PROMPT-VALIDATION-PROTOCOL.md`. This ensures clarity, completeness, security, and effectiveness.

### Quick Reference

Before any task, run these 4 checks:

1. **Purpose in first line** — Can you state what the prompt wants in one sentence?
2. **All variables defined** — Are all `{{`, `[`, `{` placeholders defined?
3. **No dangerous patterns** — No `eval`, `exec`, `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `sudo`, secrets
4. **Output format specified** — Does the prompt say what output should look like?

If ANY fail, ask for clarification before proceeding.

### Full Protocol

See `PROMPT-VALIDATION-PROTOCOL.md` for:
- Validation Levels (PERMISSIVE / STANDARD / STRICT)
- 27 Security Patterns (blocked injection vectors)
- 5-Dimension Scoring (Clarity, Completeness, Structure, Security, Effectiveness)
- 3-Dimension Checklist (Content, Structure, Technical)
- Type-Specific Checks (7 prompt types)
- 4-Step Validation Process
- Common Failures & Fix Patterns
- Validation Log Template
- Grade Calculation (A-F)
- Escalation Criteria
```

**Note:** The full `PROMPT-VALIDATION-PROTOCOL.md` should exist at the repository root. When generating a new AGENTS.md for a project, include the brief reference section above. The complete protocol can be copied from this skills repository's `PROMPT-VALIDATION-PROTOCOL.md`.

## 10. Enable Cross-Tool Compatibility

Create pointer files for tools that don't read `AGENTS.md` natively:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
Strictly follow the rules in ./AGENTS.md
```

```markdown
# .cursorrules
Follow all instructions in ./AGENTS.md in this repository.
```

Or use symlinks:
```bash
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s AGENTS.md .cursorrules
```

# Best Practices

- **Put commands early** — agents reference them on every task
- **Prefer file-scoped commands** — seconds vs. minutes per check
- **Show code examples, not descriptions** — one snippet > three paragraphs
- **Be version-specific** — `React 18 with TypeScript 5.3` not `React project`
- **Start small, iterate** — add a rule the second time you see the same mistake
- **Point to real reference files** — the agent mirrors your best examples
- **Keep it scannable** — short bullet points, tables, code blocks — not walls of prose
- **Nest for monorepos** — packages evolve independently, guidance should too
- **Give an escape hatch** — "When stuck, ask" prevents dead-end loops
- **Enforce the Three Pillars** — every AGENTS.md must have AUTOMATING, TESTING, DOCUMENTING enforcement
- **Add Prompt Validation** — every AGENTS.md should validate inputs (prompts) before agents execute, not just outputs (Three Pillars)
- **Treat AGENTS.md as code** — it should be updated in the same commit as the changes it documents
- **Use change-type checklists** — different change types require different documentation updates
- **Tie completion to all three pillars** — "task not complete until lint passes, tests pass, and docs updated"

# Validation Checklist

  - [ ] Reference to full protocol for detailed procedures

# Troubleshooting

## Issue: Agent Keeps Making the Same Mistake

**Symptoms**: Agent uses wrong state library, wrong component patterns, or wrong styling approach despite having an AGENTS.md

**Solution**:
- Add a specific Don't rule: "Do not use useState — use Zustand stores"
- Add a Do rule pointing to a reference file: "Copy pattern from `src/stores/userStore.ts`"
- Check that the AGENTS.md is at the right directory level (not too far from the files being edited)

## Issue: Agent Runs Slow Full-Project Commands

**Symptoms**: Agent runs `npm run build` or `npm test` after every small change

**Solution**:
- Add file-scoped command alternatives in the Commands section
- Add note: "Use file-scoped checks. Full builds only when explicitly requested."
- Add to Safety: "Ask first before running full build or E2E suites"

## Issue: AGENTS.md Is Too Long

**Symptoms**: Agent ignores rules at the end of a very long file, or Codex truncates it

**Solution**:
- Split into nested directory-level files
- Move detailed examples to separate referenced files
- Keep the root AGENTS.md focused on global rules
- Codex has a 32 KiB default limit (`project_doc_max_bytes`)

## Issue: AGENTS.md Becomes Stale

**Symptoms**: AGENTS.md references old dependencies, missing directories, or outdated commands

**Solution**:
- Ensure the Three Pillars DOCUMENTING section is present with change-type checklists
- Make it a Do rule: "Update AGENTS.md in the same commit as structural changes"
- Add to Boundaries: "✅ Always: Update AGENTS.md when adding dependencies, directories, or patterns"
- Add the completion block: "task not complete until all three pillars pass"
- Review and prune AGENTS.md periodically (monthly)

## Issue: Agent Ships Untested Code

**Symptoms**: Agent implements features without writing tests, or removes failing tests

**Solution**:
- Ensure the Three Pillars TESTING section specifies expectations per change type
- Add explicit rules: "New features require new tests", "Bug fixes require regression tests"
- Add to Don't: "Do not remove or weaken existing tests"
- Add to Boundaries: "🚫 Never: Remove failing tests to make the suite pass"

## Issue: Cross-Tool Inconsistency

**Symptoms**: Different AI tools behave differently on the same repo

**Solution**:
- Use a single `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth
- Create pointer files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`) that reference it
- Or use symlinks: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`

### Validation Levels

| Level | When to Use | What It Checks |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **PERMISSIVE** | Simple queries, low-risk tasks | Basic syntax, obvious security issues, purpose clarity |
| **STANDARD** | Default for all tasks | Full 4-check validation, 5-dimension scoring, type-specific checks |
| **STRICT** | Security-sensitive, shared prompts, production code | Everything in Standard + adversarial testing, peer-review simulation, edge case analysis |

---

### Quick Validation (2 minutes) — MUST PASS FOR ALL PROMPTS

If ANY of these fail, stop and ask for clarification:

| Check | How to Verify | Fail If |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Purpose in first line** | Can you state what the prompt wants in one sentence? | No clear objective, multiple competing goals |
| **2. All variables defined** | Search for `{{`, `[`, `{` — is every placeholder defined or defaulted? | Undefined variables, ambiguous references |
| **3. No dangerous patterns** | Scan for injection vectors (see Security Patterns below) | Any blocked pattern found |
| **4. Output format specified** | Does the prompt say what the output should look like? | Format undefined, multiple conflicting formats |

---

### Security Patterns — BLOCKED

These 27 patterns must be flagged and rejected:

**Script Injection (7):**
- `<script>`, `</script>`, `javascript:`
- `onerror=`, `onload=`, `onclick=`, event handlers

**Command Injection (7):**
- `eval(`, `exec(`, `subprocess`, `os.system`, `os.popen`
- Backticks `` ` ``, `${...}`, `$()`

**Path Traversal (3):**
- `../`, `..\`, `/etc/passwd`, `.env`, `.git/`

**SQL Injection (3):**
- `DROP TABLE`, `UNION SELECT`, `DELETE FROM`

**System Commands (4):**
- `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, `chmod`, `chown`, `cmd.exe`, `powershell`, `registry`

**Secrets (3):**
- Hardcoded passwords, API keys, `AWS_SECRET`, `PRIVATE_KEY`

---

### Standard Validation (10 minutes) — FOR STANDARD AND STRICT LEVELS

#### Step 1: Classify the Prompt Type

| Type | Signals |
|------|---------|
| **Code Generation** | "generate", "create", "implement", "write code" |
| **Code Refactoring** | "refactor", "improve", "optimize", "clean up" |
| **Documentation** | "document", "explain", "write docs", "describe" |
| **Analysis** | "analyze", "review", "audit", "find issues" |
| **Conversion** | "convert", "migrate", "transform", "translate" |
| **Testing** | "test", "verify", "validate", "check" |
| **Configuration** | "configure", "set up", "install", "deploy" |
| **General** | None of the above |

#### Step 2: Score 5 Dimensions (0-1 Scale)

| Dimension | Weight | Checks |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Clarity** | 25% | Single interpretation? No vague words? Imperative instructions? Scope bounded? |
| **Completeness** | 25% | All variables defined? Sufficient context? Output format? Constraints? Error handling? |
| **Structure** | 15% | Logical sections? Numbered steps? No wall of text? |
| **Security** | 20% | No injection vectors? No secrets? No dangerous ops? Output boundaries set? |
| **Effectiveness** | 15% | Tested with real input? Edge cases covered? Consistent output? |

#### Step 3: Calculate Grade

```
Final Score = (Clarity × 0.25) + (Completeness × 0.25) + (Structure × 0.15) + (Security × 0.20) + (Effectiveness × 0.15)

A: 0.90-1.00  → Proceed
B: 0.75-0.89  → Fix warnings, then proceed
C: 0.60-0.74  → Fix all issues before proceeding
D: 0.40-0.59  → Major rewrite needed
F: 0.00-0.39  → Do not proceed
```

**Automatic Failures** (forces at least a D):
- Any Security check scores 0
- Clarity "single interpretation" scores 0
- Completeness "all variables defined" scores 0
- 3+ zeros in any single dimension

### Three-Dimension Validation Checklist

Every prompt must pass these three dimensions:

**Content Validation:**
- [ ] Prompt clearly states its purpose in the first line
- [ ] All required variables are defined (no undefined placeholders)
- [ ] Context is sufficient for the task
- [ ] Output format is specified (markdown, JSON, code, etc.)
- [ ] Edge cases are considered

**Structure Validation:**
- [ ] Follows established prompt template structure
- [ ] Sections are properly organized and labeled
- [ ] Examples are provided where needed
- [ ] Instructions are sequential and logical
- [ ] Error conditions are handled

**Technical Validation:**
- [ ] All placeholders use consistent format (`{{VAR}}` not mixed `[VAR]` and `{VAR}`)
- [ ] Tool calls are properly specified (if applicable)
- [ ] File paths are correct and safe (no traversal)
- [ ] Dependencies are declared
- [ ] Security considerations are included

---

### Type-Specific Checks

After universal validation, apply these:

**Code Generation:**
- Language/framework version specified?
- Input/output types defined?
- Error handling strategy specified?
- Test expectations stated?

**Code Refactoring:**
- Behavior preservation required?
- Scope bounded (which files/modules)?
- Test requirements stated (must pass existing tests)?

**Documentation:**
- Target audience specified?
- Format specified (README, API docs, inline comments)?
- Accuracy verification method?

**Analysis:**
- Scope bounded (time range, file set, criteria)?
- Output structure defined (report format, priority levels)?
- Criteria for findings specified?
- Prioritization method defined?

**Conversion:**
- Source/target formats defined?
- Data loss policy specified?
- Edge case handling (encoding, special characters)?

**Testing:**
- Framework specified?
- Coverage expectations stated?
- Test categories defined (unit, integration, e2e)?

**Configuration:**
- Target environment specified?
- Environment variables listed?
- Secrets handling strategy defined?

### 4-Step Validation Process (For Strict Level)

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. Initial Review** | Review prompt against all checklists | Identify missing elements, note areas for improvement |
| **2. Testing** | Test with sample inputs | Verify output format, check error handling, try edge cases |
| **3. Peer Review Simulation** | Critique as if another developer | Question ambiguous terms, challenge assumptions |
| **4. Documentation** | Document validation results | Note limitations, record test cases, log grade |

---

### Common Validation Failures & Fixes

| Failure | Problem | Fix Pattern |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Missing Context** | Not enough background | Add context section with all necessary information |
| **Ambiguous Instructions** | Can be interpreted multiple ways | Be specific: "IN SCOPE: X, Y. OUT OF SCOPE: Z" |
| **No Error Handling** | Doesn't specify what to do on errors | Add: "On error: log to stderr, return empty array, do not throw" |
| **Undefined Variables** | References variables that aren't defined | Define all variables in context section with examples |
| **Vague Output Format** | "Create a good README" | "Create README.md with: H1 title, one-paragraph description, installation, usage, license" |
| **Security Blind Spots** | "Set up the database" | "Set up PostgreSQL using DATABASE_URL env var. Never hardcode credentials. Use parameterized queries" |

### Validation Log Template

When issues are found, log them in your response:

```
[Prompt Validation: Quick/Standard/Strict]
- Level: [permissive/standard/strict]
- Type: [code-gen/refactoring/documentation/analysis/conversion/testing/configuration/general]
- Issues found: X critical, Y high, Z medium
- Grade: [A/B/C/D/F] (0.XX)
- Failed checks: [list specific checks that failed]
- Actions taken: [what you fixed or asked for clarification on]
- Status: [proceeding after fix / awaiting clarification / rejected]
```

---

### Quick Validation (5-Minute Emergency Version)

For urgent prompts when you cannot do full validation:

**2-Minute Must-Have Check:**
- [ ] Purpose is clear in first line
- [ ] All variables are defined
- [ ] Error handling mentioned
- [ ] Output format specified
- [ ] Sections are labeled
- [ ] Instructions are numbered

**Red Flags — Stop Immediately:**
- ❌ No clear purpose statement
- ❌ Undefined variables or references
- ❌ No error handling instructions
- ❌ Ambiguous or vague instructions
- ❌ Security patterns present (eval, exec, rm -rf, etc.)

**3-Minute Quick Test:**
1. Test with simple input
2. Test edge case
3. Verify output format matches expectations

---

### Validation Priority Tiers

| Priority | Requirements | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **High (Must Pass)** | Blocking — cannot proceed without these | Clarity and specificity, complete context, proper error handling, security considerations |
| **Medium (Should Pass)** | Important but not blocking | Examples provided, consistent formatting, adequate testing, documentation complete |
| **Low (Nice to Have)** | Improvement opportunities | Optimization opportunities, alternative approaches, performance considerations |

---

### Security Quick Scan (For Any Sensitive Task)

For prompts touching user input, databases, files, or authentication:

1. **Secrets**: Are credentials from env vars only?
2. **Dangerous ops**: Are `eval`, `exec`, `rm`, `DROP` guarded or absent?
3. **User input flow**: Is input sanitized before databases/shells/templates?
4. **Output boundaries**: Could secrets or system info leak?
5. **Path safety**: Are file paths validated against a base directory?

If any fail → upgrade to Strict validation or ask for clarification.

---

### When to Escalate

Escalate to user (do not proceed) when:
- Grade is D or F after attempting fixes
- Security dimension scores 0
- Prompt contains dangerous patterns that cannot be sanitized
- Purpose is fundamentally unclear even after clarification attempt
- Multiple critical issues across dimensions

---

### Adaptation by Project Type

Customize the validation emphasis based on the project:

**API projects** — emphasize security checks:
- SQL injection vectors, credential handling, path traversal
- Input validation, authentication flows, rate limiting
- Secrets management, environment variable handling

**Library projects** — emphasize completeness:
- Input/output types, error handling strategy, edge cases
- API compatibility, versioning, breaking changes
- Documentation coverage, examples for all public methods

**Documentation projects** — emphasize clarity:
- Target audience, format, accuracy verification method
- Structure, navigation, cross-references
- Code example correctness, runnable snippets

**Configuration projects** — emphasize security:
- Environment variables, secrets handling, target environment
- Network access, firewall rules, access controls
- Audit trails, change management, rollback procedures

**Web/Frontend projects** — emphasize structure:
- Component boundaries, state management patterns
- Accessibility, responsive design, browser compatibility
- Performance budgets, bundle size, lazy loading

**Data/ML projects** — emphasize validation:
- Data quality checks, schema validation, missing values
- Model versioning, reproducibility, experiment tracking
- Bias detection, privacy preservation, ethical guidelines

### Integration with Three Pillars

Prompt validation is the **pre-task gate** that bookends the Three Pillars:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        TASK LIFECYCLE                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│   PROMPT VALIDATION          EXECUTION          THREE PILLARS   │
│   ─────────────────          ─────────          ─────────────   │
│   "Is input valid?"  ──▶  DO WORK  ──▶  "Is output complete?"  │
│                                                                  │
│   • 4 must-pass checks          • Code changes    • AUTOMATING  │
│   • 27 security patterns                        • TESTING        │
│   • 5-dimension scoring                         • DOCUMENTING  │
│   • Grade A-F before proceeding                                  │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Three Pillars verify **output quality**. Prompt validation verifies **input quality**. Together they ensure quality at both ends of every task.

### Maintenance

- **Review frequency**: Monthly — audit your validation habits
- **Update triggers**: When new failure patterns emerge, update Common Failures table
- **Log retention**: Keep last 10 validation logs in CHANGELOG.md for pattern analysis
