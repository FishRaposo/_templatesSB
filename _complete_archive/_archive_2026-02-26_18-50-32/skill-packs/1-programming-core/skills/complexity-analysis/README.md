# Complexity Analysis Skill

Analyze algorithm efficiency, calculate time and space complexity, identify bottlenecks, and optimize code performance.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Determine Big O time/space complexity of an algorithm
- Compare performance of different approaches
- Profile and benchmark real code
- Identify and fix performance bottlenecks

## Example Usage

```
User: My solution works but is O(n²) — how can I make it faster?

Agent: Let me analyze the nested loops and suggest an O(n) approach
using a hash map to eliminate the inner loop...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).

## Resources

- See `./_examples/basic-examples.md` for O(1), O(n), O(n²) examples
