# Modularity Skill

Design modular systems with clear boundaries, reusable components, clean interfaces, and effective dependency management.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Break a monolithic codebase into modules
- Define clean interfaces between components
- Manage dependencies and avoid circular imports
- Apply module systems (ES Modules, Python packages, Go packages, Rust crates)

## Example Usage

```
User: This 2000-line file handles users, payments, and shipping — how do I split it?

Agent: I'll identify natural module boundaries by responsibility and help you
extract each into its own module with a clean public interface...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).
