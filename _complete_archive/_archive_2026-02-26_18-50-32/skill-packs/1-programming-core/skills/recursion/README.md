# Recursion Skill

Solve problems using recursive approaches — base cases, divide-and-conquer, tree/graph traversal, memoization, and tail recursion.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Implement recursive algorithms (factorial, Fibonacci, tree traversal)
- Apply memoization to optimize overlapping subproblems
- Convert between recursive and iterative approaches
- Understand stack depth limits across languages

## Example Usage

```
User: My recursive Fibonacci is way too slow for n=50

Agent: The naive version is O(2^n). I'll add memoization — in Python use
@lru_cache, in JS use a Map cache — dropping it to O(n)...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).
