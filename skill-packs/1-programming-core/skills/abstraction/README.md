# Abstraction Skill

Simplify complex systems by hiding implementation details, designing clean interfaces, building reusable layers, and managing complexity.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Hide complexity behind a clean interface
- Design abstract classes (JS), ABCs (Python), interfaces (Go), traits (Rust)
- Build layered architectures (controller → service → repository)
- Refactor leaky or over-engineered abstractions

## Example Usage

```
User: I have 3 different database backends — how do I abstract them behind one interface?

Agent: I'll design a DataSource interface with get/save/delete methods,
then create concrete implementations for each backend...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).
