# Control Flow Skill

Design clean execution paths, implement conditional logic, manage error handling, and build state machines.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Design guard clauses and early returns for cleaner code
- Implement error handling across languages (try/catch, Result, error returns)
- Build state machines for complex workflows
- Manage async control flow and concurrency

## Example Usage

```
User: This function has 5 levels of nested if/else — how do I simplify it?

Agent: I'll refactor using guard clauses (early returns) and extract
conditions into named functions to flatten the nesting...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).

## Resources

- See `./_examples/basic-examples.md` for guard clauses, state machines, error handling
- See `./_examples/async-control-flow.md` for async patterns
- See `./_examples/flow-control-utilities.md` for production-ready utilities
