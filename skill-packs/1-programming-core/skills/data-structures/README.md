# Data Structures Skill

Select, implement, analyze, and optimize data structures for any use case.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Choose the right data structure for your access patterns
- Implement stacks, queues, trees, graphs, or hash maps
- Analyze time/space complexity of data structure operations
- Optimize data structure performance

## Example Usage

```
User: I need fast lookups by key and also iteration in insertion order

Agent: Use a Map (JS), OrderedDict (Python), or LinkedHashMap (Java).
I'll help you implement this with the right trade-offs...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).

## Resources

- See `./_examples/basic-examples.md` for stack and queue implementations
