# Functional Paradigm Skill

Write clean, predictable code using pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, and function composition.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Refactor imperative code to functional style
- Build data transformation pipelines (map/filter/reduce)
- Implement pure functions and immutable data patterns
- Use currying, partial application, and composition

## Example Usage

```
User: This data processing code mutates state everywhere — how do I make it functional?

Agent: I'll refactor to use pure functions with map/filter/reduce pipelines,
replacing mutations with immutable transformations...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).

## Resources

- See `./_examples/basic-examples.md` for pure functions, HOFs, composition
- See `./_examples/functional-data-structures.md` for immutable lists, monads
