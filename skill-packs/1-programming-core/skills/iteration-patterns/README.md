# Iteration Patterns Skill

Implement efficient iteration using map/filter/reduce, generators, iterators, and advanced patterns like sliding window and two pointers.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Choose the right loop pattern (for, for...of, map, filter, reduce)
- Optimize loops for performance
- Implement generators and custom iterators
- Apply advanced patterns (sliding window, two pointers, chunking)

## Example Usage

```
User: I'm processing a huge file line by line and running out of memory

Agent: I'll help you switch to a generator-based approach that processes
one chunk at a time without loading everything into memory...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).
