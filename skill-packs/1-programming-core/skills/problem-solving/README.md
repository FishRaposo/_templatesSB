# Problem Solving Skill

Approach challenges systematically using decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking.

## Quick Start

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Break a complex problem into manageable sub-problems
- Recognize common patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, greedy, DP)
- Design a solution strategy before coding
- Iterate and refine solutions with test-driven development

## Example Usage

```
User: I need to find the maximum subarray sum — where do I start?

Agent: Let's decompose this: first understand the constraints, then consider
brute force O(n²), then optimize to Kadane's algorithm O(n)...
```

## Languages

Examples in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. See `../PACK.md` for the **Language Adaptation Guide** (C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc.).
