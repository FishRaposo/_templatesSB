# Current Context — TestProject

_Immediate trajectory and active work. Ephemeral — regenerate every session from CHANGELOG.md + graph.md._

**Last updated**: 2026-02-28 09:58  
**Event horizon**: evt-001  
**Session**: Project initialization

---

## Active Mission

Initialize TestProject with complete documentation and development environment.

_Source: most recent milestone or decision events in CHANGELOG.md_

---

## Active Tasks

| Task | Priority | Status | Blockers |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Set up development environment | high | active | none |
| Review and customize documentation | medium | active | none |
| Implement initial features | medium | pending | none |

_Source: graph.md nodes where Type = task, Status = active_

---

## Active Constraints

- Follow conventions defined in AGENTS.md
- All changes must satisfy Three Pillars

_Source: recent decision events defining boundaries_

---

## Blockers

- None currently

_Source: graph.md edges where Relation = blocks and target is active node_

---

## Recent Changes

- 2026-02-28 — Initialize project documentation — evt-001

_Source: last 20 events or last 48 hours from CHANGELOG.md_

---

## Key Dependencies

- None identified yet

_Source: graph.md edges where Relation = depends_on for active components_

---

## Next Actions

1. Review and customize AGENTS.md for project-specific rules
2. Update README.md with actual project details
3. Set up development environment per QUICKSTART.md

_Source: active tasks minus blockers, respecting precedes edges in graph.md_

---

## Staleness Check

Compare `Event horizon` above with the last event ID in CHANGELOG.md.  
If they differ → regenerate this file before proceeding.

**Algorithm**:
1. Read graph.md — list all nodes with Status = active or blocked
2. Read CHANGELOG.md — last 20 events or last 48 hours (whichever is more)
3. Fill each section above mechanically — do not editorialize

_Regenerate: every session start_
